Sales Efficiency = Net New ARR / Sales & Marketing Expense.

'21:
Net New ARR = $4.444M.
Sales & Marketing Expense = $3.837M.
Sales Efficiency = $4.444M / $3.837M ≈ 1.16.


'22: 
Net New ARR = $5.547M.
Sales & Marketing Expense = $6.349M.
Sales Efficiency = $5.547M / $6.349M ≈ 0.87.

=> Decrease from 1.16 in 2021 to 0.87 in 2022 suggests reduced efficiency, probs due to increased investment in scaling operations.
